Run "Signal" and CBT1 with USB cable first. Third number from top is current value.
At bottom CS ERRORS = number of lost data frames. To use Bluetooth mode :
On your PC, select Start > Settings > Devices > Bluetooth & other devices > 
> Add Bluetooth or other device > Bluetooth. Turn CBT1 power on ."AT 52832X" will appear.
Choose it and wait "Paired", then select Done.You have to do it only once.
If you don't see "AT 52832X" then your PC doesn't have Bluetooth 5.
TURN OFF power on CBT1. Disconnect USB cable(if connected) turn power on
and THEN run program "Signal" or other. If you start getting CS ERRORS 
then you have bad radio channel.TURN OFF and then turn power on for new run.
If your program doesn't have Humidity and Battery% then copy only XXXDRIVER and USBRS.
